## This is the project that I made durring the <em>LSEG Quant Challange 2025</em>.

In the <code>Price History_2025.xlsx</code> file there is a time series representing the price of an index fund. For the contest I was asked to predict the price for next 5 days.

I end-up using the autoregressive model because it was the simplest and easy to interpret. In the notebook <code>Coduri Iustin.ipynb </code> you see how I applied the model and some data visualisation.

In <code>Price History_2025 prezis.xlsx</code> file is the forecast added to the time series.
